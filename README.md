# Forest Explorer
==========
Forest Explorer is a web tool that can be used to easily browse the contents of the Cross-Forest dataset, a resource containing the forestry inventory and land cover map from Spain.

These are some of the features of Forest Explorer:

* The tool can run in any device with a modern browser

* Effective hiding of RDF/OWL/SPARQL

* Interactive map for navigating the area of interest

* Adaptable to different zoom levels

* Easy filtering of forestry data

* Available in English and Spanish


Usage
==========
Forest Explorer is a web application developed in Javascript. You can easily deploy it in your web server, but you need to set up your own SPARQL endpoint with the dataset. 

Alternatively, you can just try a live version of Forest Explorer on [https://forestexplorer.gsic.uva.es](https://forestexplorer.gsic.uva.es)
