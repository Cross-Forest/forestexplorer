Usage
==========
Forest Explorer is a web application developed in Javascript. You can easily deploy it in your web server, but you need to set up your own SPARQL endpoint with the dataset. 

Alternatively, you can just try a live version of Forest Explorer on [https://forestexplorer.gsic.uva.es](https://forestexplorer.gsic.uva.es)
